## Problems Discussed in class
  
  - Quick Sort  -> quicksort.cpp
  
  - Binary Search  -> binarySearch.cpp
  
  - Lower Bound (first occurrence of a number) using binary search -> binarySearch.cpp
  
  - Square root of a number using binary search -> SquareRoot.cpp

  - Given an array arr[0 .. n-1] of distinct integers, the task is to find a local minima in it. We say that an element arr[x] is a local minimum if it is less than or equal to both its neighbors.

	*	For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbor for comparison.
	* 	There can be more than one local minima in an array, we need to find any one of them. 
	-> localMinima.cpp
