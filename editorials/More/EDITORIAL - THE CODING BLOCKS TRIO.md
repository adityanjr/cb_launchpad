## THE CODING BLOCKS TRIO
##### Problem Link : [The Coding Blocks Trio](https://hack.codingblocks.com/contests/c/1001/1206)  

Here, we need to consider all the subsets of size **3** of the given list of strings, and check whether all the strings in each subset have at least one vowel common. We can follow the top down dynamic approach for the same. First we will use bits to manage count of vowel in each string.

We will assign particular bit position for each vowel, say for a = 1<sup>st</sup> bit, e = 2<sup>nd</sup> bit and so on.. and for each string, we will consider **5** bits, and will set them if a string a vowel.

```C++
int vount_vowels =0;
say for string "ae":
count_vowels = count_vowels | (1<<1) for a.
count_vowels = count_vowels | (1<<2) for e.
```

and after that we will apply dynamic programming approach with states **id, mask, count**:

>`id` = represents the index of the string considered in the subset

>`mask` = represents the number of vowels common in the considered strings.

>`count` = number of strings considered earlier for the subset.

For each string, we can consider it in the current subset or can leave and can move on other string. We will store the result calculated up to a for each state, to avoid the re calculation.

_**Time Complexity:** O( N x 2^V-1 x G)_ where N = Maximum Number Of students,V = Number of Vowels, G = Group Size
