## Problems Discussed in class
  - What is Recursion?
  - Factorial -> factorial.cpp
  - Fibonacci -> fibonacci.cpp
  - Print increasing and decreasing sequence -> increasingDecreasing.cpp
  - Insert * between two consecutive 'x's -> insertStar.cpp
  - Linear Search -> linearSearch.cpp
  - Print substrings of a string -> substring.cpp
  - Print subsequences of given string -> subsequence.cpp

### Home work problems
 - Given n friends, each one can remain single or can be paired up with some other friend. Each friend can be paired only once. Find out the total number of ways in which friends can remain single or can be paired up.
 - Given two integers x and n, write a function to compute x^n. 
 	for eg. Input : x = 2, n = 3
			Output : 8
