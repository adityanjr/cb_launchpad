  - Print all the subarrays of a given array -> generateSubarrays.cpp
  - Maximum sum subarray O(n^3) -> maxsum1.cpp
  - Maximum sum subarray O(n^2) -> maxSum2.cpp
  - Maximum sum subarray O(n) [Kadane's Algo] -> maxsum3.cpp
  - Bubble Sort -> bubblesort.cpp
  - Selection Sort -> selectionsort.cpp

### Home work problems
