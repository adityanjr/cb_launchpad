Definition: “Pythagorean triplets” are integer solutions to the Pythagorean Theorem, i.e. they satisfy the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Our task is to generate a triplet from an integral value. This can be a confusing task because, the side given to us can be a hypotenuse or a non-hypotenuse side.
Starting to calculate triplets by putting them in a formula, it can be deduced that only for 1 and 2, no triplets are possible.
Further,
if n is even, our triplets are calculated by formula (n^2/4 - 1)^2 + n^2 = (n^2/4 + 1)^2

if n is odd, our triplets are calculated by formula (n^2-1)^2/2  + n^2 = (n^2+1)^2/2

Proof:
Pythagoras Theorem can also be written as c^2 - b^2 = a^2
i.e a*a = (c-b)(c+b)
a*a x 1 = a*a, thus c = (a^2+1)/2 and b = (a^2 - 1)/2, this solution works if n is odd.
For even solution, c+b = n^2/2, c-b=2, thus, we get the above formula when n is even.
