## FRIENDS AT CODING BLOCKS
##### Problem Link : [Friends At Coding Blocks](https://hack.codingblocks.com/contests/c/1001/1204)  

Here the main observation is that, the batch will always be formed of prime numbers which are less than or equal to **N**. Possible combinations of largest batches can be all the subsets containing numbers which are co-prime to each other, but as we need the lexicographically smallest combination , when sorted in ascending order, it will restrict us to choose all the prime numbers which are less than or equal to N. 
Now in order to get the minimum total friction, we need to arrange them efficiently. To define an efficient arrangement we need to consider each possible arrangement and can see which arrangement gives us the minimum total friction.
We can follow the top down approach of Dynamic Programming with the states mask, and prev.
> mask = represents the prime numbers which are choosen till now.

> prev = represents the last prime number we chose. 

For each position in the batch, we will have the choice of choosing a prime number from the remaining prime numbers which have not been chosen yet. To represent the prime numbers which are already chosen, we will use the mask. 

**How?** 

As there will always be less than `20` prime numbers, you can take the `integer` **(mask )** (where each position of bit will represent the prime number), where `1` on `ith`
position in the mask represents that `ith` prime number is selected earlier in the arrangement, and `0`represent it is not. 

We will the store the answer of state mask,prev in the matrix **dp[prev][mask]** to avoid re-calculation the same state again. here **dp[prev][mask]** represents the minimum friction where total number of primes selected is equal to the number set bits in mask.


_**Time Complexity:** O(N x 2<sup>N</sup>)_ where N = number of primes less than 50
