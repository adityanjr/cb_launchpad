## XORED ARRANGEMENT
##### Problem Link : [XORed Arrangement](https://hack.codingblocks.com/contests/c/1001/1225)  

We are given arrays **A** and **P**. The value of operation of the i<sup>th</sup> value of the array A is defined as `A`<sub>`i-2`</sub> `^ A`<sub>`i-1`</sub>  `^ A`<sub>`i`</sub> `for all i â‰¥ 2. For i = 0` and `i = 1`, `A`<sub>`i`</sub> `= 0`. We wish to minimize the sum of `A`<sub>`i`</sub> `* P`<sub>`i`</sub> `for i ranging from 0 to n - 1`.

A brute force solution for this problem would be to try all the **n!** permutations of the array **A** and minimize sum of **Ai * Pi** for all **i**. But the complexity of this approach would be **O(n! * n)** which would exceed the time limit. So, let's go for a better approach.

This problem requires dynamic programming with bitmasking. We can see that values at 3 different indices need to be considered for calculating the value at a certain **Ai**. Also, since we have **n** elements, we have **2<sup>n</sup>** possibilities of choosing or not choosing a certain index. This way, we can build subsets of elements we're considering and arrive at a solution for the total problem. We will try an **O(n<sup>2</sup> * 2<sup>n</sup>)** solution that takes **O(n<sup>2</sup> * 2<sup>n</sup>)** space.

Let **DP[mask][fr][sec]** denote the minimum value of the function we wish to minimize considering only the indices that are active in the mask, such that the last index considered so far is `fr` and the second last is `sec`.

>**DP[mask][fr][sec] = min(DP[mask][fr][sec], (A[fr]^A[sec]^A[th]) * P[bitcount(mask) - 1] + DP[mask | (1 << th)][fr][sec])**
 
for all `th` that are inactive in mask and for all `fr` and `sec` that are active in mask. This implies that we're going to `th` having visited `fr` and then `sec` which is why we wish for `th` to be inactive in `mask` and `fr` and `sec` to be active.

_**Time Complexity:** O(n<sup>2</sup> * 2<sup>n</sup>)_ where n is the size of the array.
