## Problems Discussed in class
  
  - Take as input N, the size of a N * N board. We are asked to place N number of queens in it, so that no queen can kill other. Print a possible configuration to place N queens.  -> nqueen.cpp
  
  - Take as input N, the size of a N * N board. We are asked to place N number of queens in it, so that no queen can kill other. Print all the possible configurations to place N queens.  -> allNqueen.cpp
  
  -  Write a recursive function which prints all the words possible by rearranging the characters of this string(permutations). -> permutations.cpp
  
  - A Maze is given as M * N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[M-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down. You need to find if rat can reach at the destination or not. -> ratinmaze.cpp

  - A Maze is given as M * N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[M-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down. You need to print the path of the rat from source to destination (if path exist). -> printRatinMaze.cpp

  - Given a string of digits, where every digit represents a  letter (1- a, 2-b, 26-z). Print all the words that we can generate from that string. 
 	For example: 123 - abc, lc, aw. 
 			456 - def.
  -> codeOfStrings.cpp

A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down. You need to count all the paths of the rat from source to destination (if path exist).
