  Mistakes -
   0) Dont rush to conclusion on seeing a question , keep yourself relaxed and go easy on ques .
   1) To see at each step if integer is not causing an error , best way is to use long long always.
   2) To see if my solution can be verified , if yes then do that .
   3) To see if my code can be simplified , if yes make it simple.
   4) If my code is wrong , dont be in a hurry to change to the code, first think for 2 min if any modification can be done to make it
      right.
   5) always typecast (int) arr.size() because   size_t does not support subtraction.
   6) Never use such expression   Int ct = max( ct ,left) ; (declartion should be done before assignment , absurd behaviour)
   7) Using long long for everything may cause Time Limit Exceeded some times , so better be sure
   8) appending at the end of the string takes too much time 339 Div2 - B
   9) n*n*log(n) doesnt wrk for n >1000 on codeforces
   10) read the question carefully and before submitting soln read ques , it will hardly take 1min and save u  time cost of 15-30 min
   11) Keep calm and Code.
