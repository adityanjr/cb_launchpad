## HOODIES AT CODING BLOCKS
##### Problem Link : [Hoodies At Coding Blocks](https://hack.codingblocks.com/admin/preview/1244)  

Just store the students of each course in a different queue. At any moment, the actual queue will contain 4 divisions, each for a particular course and that can be simulated as different queues. Whenever a new student joins an existing student from his course, he will always get to put his name right after his friend in front, hence the same timestamp as his friend's, but just behind him in the queue. Therefore we maintain a timestamp for each course. However if a student does not find any existing student from the same course, he will join the queue at last, hence the largest timestamp will be allocated to that course's queue.

Finally just find the queue with the minimum timestamp , provided there is a student in the queue and then pop that student from his queue.If the queue becomes empty, simply reset the timestamp of that queue to indicate no student.

_**Time Complexity:** O(Q)_ where Q = Number of queries
