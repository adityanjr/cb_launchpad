## SINGHAM AND MAZE
##### Problem Link : [Singham And Maze](https://hack.codingblocks.com/contests/c/1001/1188)  

In this problem you had to simulate route of character in graph. 
Note that if you are in vertice **i**, then edges in all vertices with numbers less than **i** are turned to **p<sub>i</sub>**.

Let **dp<sub>i</sub>** represent the number of portals needed to move to the next room.

Let **sum<sub>i</sub>** will represent the cumulative sum of the number of portals needed to move to the `i+1`th room from the first room.

Then just traverse to each room and compute the `dp[i]` values for each `i` in the following manner and update `sum[]` accordingly:

> If portal 2 takes back to the same room, then dp[i] will be 2 because using portal 2 it will come back to the same room at the first(odd) time it enters room i and then using portal 1, he will move to the next room as it will be the second(even) time he enters the room `i`.

> If portal 2 takes to some previous room a, then Singham will use portal 2 to go to the room a, then come back to room i, then use portal 1 to move ahead, so in order to find out the number of portals to move from room a to room i, we will be maintaining a cumulative sum array containing the cumulative sum of the number of portals needed to move from room i to room i+1 for every room from 1 to i.
Hence , the total number of portals will be `2 + sum[i-1] - sum[a-1]`.

_**Time Complexity:** O(N)_ where N is the total Number Of Rooms in the maze.
