## VIPUL'S REDMI 4
##### Problem Link : [Vipul's Redmi 4](https://hack.codingblocks.com/admin/preview/1238)  

In the allotted time, we can see some photos from the beginning and some from the end since we can not skip any photo and move ahead. There are 4 cases:

1. We always go right.
2. We always go left.
3. We initially go right, then reverse direction, go through all visited photos and continue going left.
4. We initially go left, then reverse direction, go through all visited photos and continue going right.

First two cases can be easily coded. Third and fourth cases can be done with the method of two pointers. Note that if we see one more picture to the right, we spend more time on the right side and the number of photos seen to the left will decrease.
Also note that we should finish watching pics on one side before moving to the other side as it would simply be a waste of time if we keep rolling from one side to another, since we had to maximise the number of pics.

_**Time Complexity:** O(N)_ where N = Number of pics in Vipul's phone

Read below commented code for implementation details.
