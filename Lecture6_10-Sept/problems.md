## Problems Discussed in class

  - Find and count all the elements before which all the elements are greater than it, and after which all are smaller (in O(n) with using 2n space) -> leftGrightSbetter.cpp
  - Find and count all the elements before which all the elements are greater than it, and after which all are smaller (in O(n) with using n space) -> leftGrightSbetter.cpp

### Concepts -> pointers.cpp

	- Address of operator (&)
	- Pointers
	- Dereference operator 
	- size of different variables or need of defining data type in pointers
	- exceptional behaviour for char
	- pointer's significance in arrays
