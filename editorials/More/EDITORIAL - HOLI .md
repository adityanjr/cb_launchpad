## HOLI
##### Problem Link : [HOLI](https://hack.codingblocks.com/contests/c/1001/771)  

The problem can be solved if viewed from the `edges` point of view, rather than `nodes` point of view.One can easily observe that to obtain the maximum distance travelled by all the visitors, each edge should be travelled by maximum possible number of visitors. Since the maximum visitors which can travel the edge is minimum of the total number of nodes to the left and right of the edge, hence we compute it using DFS. If number of visitors one side of the edge is a,then the number of visitors on the other side of the edge automatically becomes n-a. 

For further analysis, refer [this](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/8149?locale=en).
_**Time Complexity:** O(E)_ where E = Number of edges in the given graph(tree).
