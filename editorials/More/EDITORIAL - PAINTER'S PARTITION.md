## Painter's Partition Problem
##### Problem Link : [Painter's Partition Problem](https://hack.codingblocks.com/contests/c/133/716)  
The problem aims at finding the minimum time needed to paint all the boards. So, we should start thinking how we can check if any given time is minimum or not. For this, we can simply check if it is possible to paint all the fences satisfying all the constraints. If it is possible, we can go on checking for smaller values. And if it is not, we can increase the time. 

Now since we have a deciding factor ready using which we can move either left or right, it very much points towards the application of binary search. 
So, clearly, we would be applying the binary search over the time needed to paint all the fences.
We can definitely choose the minimum and maximum time needed to be 0 and INT_MAX(infinity) values. Rather practically speaking, it should be chosen in this manner only as definitely the answer would converge to the correct point. But just for basic understanding, one can think that the maximum time will be taken when only one painter is painting all the boards and rest all are sitting idle. (Which painter we choose, doesn't matter since in the given question, all painters take equal time). However the minimum time can be zero as there can be no fences to be painted. In this way, we can make informed decision about the choices of lower bound and the upper bound of the values of the time taken to start the binary search. But as alredy stated, this won't be needed and we can set them arbitrarily to 0 and infinity respectively in most cases. 

Refer the below commented code to see the implementation details. 

_**Time Complexity:** O(log T * max(Number of painters,Number of fences))_ where T = maximum time needed to paint all the fences (INT_MAX here).
