## RANDOM QUERY
##### Problem Link : [Random Query](https://hack.codingblocks.com/contests/c/126/834)  

The solution is very simple.Just change the way you look at the question! Rather than thinking in terms of segments, think what all segments each number could be a part of. And that will solve the question in O(N) time.

Take a number, find its last occurence, then count the numbers between the number and its last occurence, then simply mulitply it with the total count of numbers on its right hand side. You are bascially adding 1 to all the ranges which consists of that number, each time you do that.

Once we have computed the total number of unique elements in all the segments,we then divide it with the total number of possible segments which comes out to be N<sup>2</sup>. Note that a segment can also has L>R in which case we have to swap the L and R. So, the total number of segments comes out to be : 
>`N(when L==R) + (N*(N-1)/2)(for all segments where L<R) + (N*(N-1)/2)(for all segments where L>R) = N`<sup>2</sup>.

_**Time Complexity:** O(N)_ where N = Number of elements in the array.

Read below commented code for implementation details.
```C++

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#include<unordered_set>
using namespace std;
 #define fio ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)
 
#define ll long long int

#define s(x) scanf("%lld",&x)
#define s2(x,y) s(x)+s(y)
#define s3(x,y,z) s(x)+s(y)+s(z)
 
#define p(x) printf("%lld\n",x)
#define p2(x,y) p(x)+p(y)
#define p3(x,y,z) p(x)+p(y)+p(z)
#define F(i,a,b) for(ll i = (ll)(a); i <= (ll)(b); i++)
#define RF(i,a,b) for(ll i = (ll)(a); i >= (ll)(b); i--)
 
#define ff first
#define ss second
#define mp(x,y) make_pair(x,y)
#define pll pair<ll,ll>
#define pb push_back

ll inf = 1e18;
ll mod = 1e9 + 7 ;
ll gcd(ll a , ll b){return b==0?a:gcd(b,a%b);}

int main()
{
	// freopen("input.txt","r",stdin);
 	// freopen("output.txt","w",stdout);
	ll t=1;
	//s(t);
	while(t--){
		ll n;
		s(n);
		vector<ll>ar(1000000+5,0);
		F(i,1,n)cin>>ar[i];
		ll ans=0ll;
		// occ[z] will contain the array index where the number z was last found
		vector<ll> occ(1000000+5,0);
		F(i,1,n){
			ans+=(i-occ[ar[i]])*(n-i+1)*2 - 1ll;
			occ[ar[i]]=i;
		}
		double res = (double)(ans)/(double)(n*n);
		printf("%.6lf\n",res);
	}
}
