## Problems Discussed in class
  - Given n friends, each one can remain single or can be paired up with some other friend. Each friend can be paired only once. Find out the total number of ways in which friends can remain single or can be paired up. -> friendPairing.cpp
  - Print all binary strings of size N without consecutive 1’s -> generateBinaryStrings.cpp
  - Count all binary strings of size N without consecutive 1’s -> generateBinaryStrings -> countBinaryStrings.cpp
  - Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
	1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
	2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
	3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

  - Given a keypad as shown in diagram, and a n digit number, list all words which are possible by pressing these numbers.
	For example if input number is 234, possible words which can be formed are:
	adg adh adi aeg aeh aei afg afh afi bdg bdh bdi beg beh bei bfg bfh bfi cdg cdh cdi ceg ceh cei cfg cfh cfi 
	-> phoneKeypad.cpp
  - Merge Sort -> mergeSort.cpp
 
### Home work problems
 - Given a string of digits, where every digit represents a  letter (1- a, 2-b, 26-z). Print all the words that we can generate from that string. 
 	For example: 123 - abc, lc, aw. 
 			456 - def.
