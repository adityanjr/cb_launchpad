## Pair of Roses
##### Problem Link : [Pair of Roses](https://hack.codingblocks.com/contests/c/133/696)  

This problem is a very basic application of binary search. Since we need to find a pair of roses whose sum of prices must satisfy the given sum, we will simply sort the prices of the roses, then traverse the array linearly. For every price, we would like to see if there exists another rose whose price is equal to the remaining money Deepak has. Hence we would do a binary search over the 
array for the needed price.

_**Time Complexity:** O(N*logN)_

**Note that this question can also be accomplished by using hash map in lesser time complexity of O(N) where N is the total number of roses.**
